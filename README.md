# Getting_and_Cleaning_Data_Course_Project

This project uses the knowledge from the 4 sections of the course by developing data analysis. The following instructions were required.

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Using data from a experiment were each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.

The files used in this project are: 

- UCI HAR Dataset: This file contains information of the experiment, using different commands in R it'll be easy to read the files in it. 
- Tidy Data: This file contains the R code used to develop the data analysis of the mean and standard deviation information of the experiment.
To use the code file, you should set the working directory where the UCI HAR Dataset exists.
